# Color Scheme Generator

## About this project

I've worked on this project as part of the Front-end developer Path @ scrimba.com
This was one of my favorite projects because:
* I discovered The Color API which blew my mind.
* I got to play around with HTML, CSS & JS
* I ended up with something very useful for myself.

## How to use
With the color picker you can select any color. Then choose the type of scheme you would like to output. Click the generate new Scheme button and 'Voila!' you have your beautiful scheme.
Afterwards just select a color to copy it to your clipboard.
